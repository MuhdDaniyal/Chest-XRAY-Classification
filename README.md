# Chest X-ray Classification for COVID-19

This project uses deep learning to classify chest X-ray images as COVID-19 positive or negative. The model aims to assist in the early detection of COVID-19 based on radiographic features visible in X-ray scans.

## Features
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning for improved accuracy.
- **Dataset**: A collection of labeled COVID-19 and non-COVID X-ray images.
- **Preprocessing**: Resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization of images.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Results
Model achieves high accuracy in detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images, making it a useful tool for supporting diagnostic workflows.
